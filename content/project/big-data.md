Information is now the most valuable commodity in the global economy surpassing oil. As individuals, we can access data pools (through Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) but are quite clueless to what portion of the pool we are actually allowed to view and influence. 
Besides the fact that this data is being used for targeted ads and privacy violations, we need to start building tools that understand how much information related to a topic we have access to. 
I believe this is of the upmost importance since it directly impacts core cognitive processes in human development. 
I am working on tools that improve data filtering  so that not only they are exposed to reliable information but they can also understand how to progress in their learning. **More details to follow soon!**
