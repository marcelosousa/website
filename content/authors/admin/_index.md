I am interested in the analysis of automated reasoning procedures in the context of programming languages and formal software verification.

In particular, I have been investigating redundancy-aware procedures in static analysis, compiler optimizations and state-space exploration methods mostly connected to relational verification and concurrent systems.

I am the recipient of the 2016 Google PhD Fellowship in Programming Languages and Software Engineering.
