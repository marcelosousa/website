I am working on technologies and methodologies towards a new generation of products that improve how people collaborate with others and their cyber-physical ecosystems.

My current interests encompass a broad spectrum of areas from computer-aided software verification and developer tools to help developers produce high-reliability and high-quality software faster to the combination of robotics, IoT and architecture to improve the quality of life of those who live in highly populated areas. For more details, see my [ongoing projects](#projects) - don't hesitate to contact me for more information!
 
I hold a D.Phil. (PhD) in Computer Science from the University of Oxford. I have been fortunate to have experienced universities and companies in Portugal, Canada, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, USA and the United Kingdom. For more details on my education and industrial experience, see my [résumé](./files/cv.pdf).
