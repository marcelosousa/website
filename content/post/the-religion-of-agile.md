**Agile**, the software development methodology turned into a religion, is built on the fallacy that the complexity inherent in the fuzzy collective intelligence of a group of people, a.k.a. thin air, can be broken up into clearly defined simple tasks.

It is a brilliant business strategy as it shifts the error rate from the client side into the process itself. We have fewer unhappy clients because they are now a part of that collective intelligence. *What happens if the whole thing blows up*? Well, the process canâ€™t be blamed; remember that the client is never wrong. So the blame is shifted to some stakeholders and they are usually software developers. Their way of coping with this social phenomenon was to focus on the speed of execution and the creation of a myth: the 10x engineer.
