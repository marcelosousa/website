*Code is eating the world* — we have heard it a hundred times. Programmers are the ones producing this code, so a logical question is: *what is happening to them?* As usual, the answer depends on the subject but I will argue that **some are getting fat while most are starting to starve**. I don’t mean physical starvation because they don’t have money to buy food — I’m talking about intellectual starvation in the style of the famous [Buridan’s ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass) paradox.
