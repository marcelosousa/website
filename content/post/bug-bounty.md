There is an increasing trend to use bug bounty programs to complement "certified" security. Some exciting news from this summer include:

- The Digital Defense Service finds bug bounty programs more cost-effective than hiring "security" companies for penetration testing ([article](https://www.cnet.com/news/how-the-air-force-relied-on-hackers-to-secure-its-move-to-the-cloud/)). Truth is that hackers found 46 vulnerabilities after security auditors gave the all clear!
 
- Microsoft shared this week at Black Hat that it has given $4.4 million in bounty rewards over the past 12 months. The top Azure bug bounty is now at $40,000 ([article](https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/05/microsoft-launches-azure-security-lab-doubles-top-bug-bounty-to-40000/)). Excited to look more into the Azure Security Lab!

- Google has also increased the value of bug bounties  recently ([article](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-will-now-pay-up-to-30000-for-reporting-a-chrome-bug/))

- In Jan 2019, the European Union launched a bug bounty program on popular open source software with a pool of ~$1M ([article](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/01/07/eu-bounty-bugs-open-source-software/))

- According to HackerOne, Paypal has spent $1,411,230 in their bug bounty program launched on Aug 2018 ([article](https://hackerone.com/paypal))
