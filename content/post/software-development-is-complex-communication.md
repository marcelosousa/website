Behind every piece of code produced by a human is an intention. The intention should answer the question: *why should this code exist*? Fundamentally, the quality of code is related to this intention. For example, saying that you have written an elegant piece of code without stating the intention of that code is non-sensical.

Software developers usually call this intention **specification**. All software should start from an **informal specification**, a representation of some intention that is shared by a group of people. I say *should* because sometimes, developers are too eager to start coding without a clue of what the intention really is. This can be because these informal specifications are not clear enough to be communicated or because the communication between team members is not effective.
