We are living in the era of the **asynchronous** — the promise land of everything will work out or will go terribly wrong *but not just yet so keep on pushing*. 
This movement has not only infiltrated our machines and how they run software but also our collaborations in extreme ways.

Every time I think of *async*, the epitome of *asynchronous processes*, I remember this [unfortunate scene](https://youtu.be/nBn3BkXrv-E?t=53) of the TV show Narcos about *magical realism*. 
Magical realism is a style of fiction popularised by Gabriel García Márquez that combines a genuine realistic description of the world with magical elements. I also remember every time I had to communicate with some governmental body or giant corporation and the stress of not knowing if and when you will hear from them.
