I was born in Porto, Portugal and 
I spent most of my adult life outside of Portugal for post-graduate studies and professional jobs. 

I hold a D.Phil. (PhD) in Computer Science from the University of Oxford. 
I have been fortunate to have experienced universities and companies in Portugal, Canada, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, USA and the United Kingdom. 

I consider myself a [multipotentialite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality) and I enjoy writing and sharing ideas with everyone.
I write about Software Development and Code Quality on a weekly basis on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@marceloabsousa)**.

For more details on my education and industrial experience, see my [CV](/files/cv.pdf).
