I was born in Porto, Portugal and 
I spent most of my adult life outside of Portugal for post-graduate studies and professional jobs. 

I hold a D.Phil. (PhD) in Computer Science from the University of Oxford. 
I have been fortunate to have experienced universities and companies in Portugal, Canada, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, USA and the United Kingdom. 

For more details on my education and industrial experience, see my [CV](./files/cv.pdf).
